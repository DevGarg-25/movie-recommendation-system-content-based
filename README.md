Here I have use 2 data sets from tmdb data set located in the Resources folder
These are tmdb_5000_credits.csv and tmdb_5000_movies.csv

You need to run movie_recommendation_system.py file file first as it dumps 2 (.pkl) files which will be required by our app.py file
1. movie_dict.pkl
2. similarity.pkl

My web-app is app.py
You may run it using command $ streamlit run app.py in the terminal.

movie_recommendation_system.py is the file for preprocessing of data and a sample how my code runs.
