Here I have use 2 data sets from tmdb data set
they are tmdb_5000_credits.csv and tmdb_5000_movies.csv

you need to run movie_recommender_system.py file file first as it dumps 2 .pkl file which will be required by our app.py file

My app is app.py
you may run it using command $ streamlit run app.py
movie recommendation system is the file for preprocessing of data and a sample how my code runs.
